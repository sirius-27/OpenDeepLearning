## Our Story

[OpenDeepLearning](#) was founded in 2023 by [Sirius](https://github.com/sirius-27), an avid learner of AI & ML. Sirius had been educating himself in artificial intelligence from free online resources, such as books, blogs and courses. He identified a gap in comprehensive AI guidance despite the availability of learning materials, which also hindered his younger brother's learning. As an open source and AI advocate, he founded OpenDeepLearning to offer a structured and supportive learning environment for AI enthusiasts seeking a clear learning path.
